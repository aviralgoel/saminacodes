# Hi, I'm Samina! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I am a developer advocate at thirdweb! I primarily focus on helping developers
learn about web3 and how to build web3 apps. Sometimes I code fun little side projects.
Outside of work, I am a huge fan of Marvel movies, play video games, and I like to draw.


## 🛠 Skills
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React... I did like two years of Java in college? Also, really good at creating templates on Notion
